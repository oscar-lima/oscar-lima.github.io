I am a researcher at the [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.dfki.de), 
[Robotics Innovation Center](https://robotik.dfki-bremen.de) in Bremen, Germany.

I am interested in making robots to reason about the environment and the task that is given to them to accomplish.
My research interests are in task planning, execution and monitoring, specifically: robot executives. e.g. state machines, 
petri nets, plan based control (PDDL, HTN), plexil, pike, ROSPlan esterel, etc.

I am currently studying my PhD remotely at University of Lisbon in Portugal and advised by 
[Prof. Dr. Rodrigo Ventura](http://users2.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/~yoda/newhome/).
Human-aware planning and execution for service domestic robots.

I completed my master degree in 2016 by [Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg's](https://www.h-brs.de/en) as part of the 
[Master of Autonomous Systems](https://www.h-brs.de/en/inf/study/master/autonomous-systems) Program.

Other interests include programming in the Robot Operating System [ROS](www.ros,org), [ROSPlan](https://kcl-planning.github.io/ROSPlan),
answering question on [ROS answers](http://answers.ros.org/users/21475/oscar-lima/) and [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Oscar-Lima-8).
